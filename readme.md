## API's using Node.js and Express.js  
Implemented two API's using Node and Express  
**API 1:** POST API which accepts a CSV file, parses it and stores the content in a database.  
**API 2:** GET API which fetches the content from the database and returns a JSON response.     

Used MySql database to store the CSV file. The MySql database is not uploaded, so create a **Database=visit** and the **table=health** To see how to make the connection check **db_conn.js**  
The final running code is **run.js**, but the code is also split into small parts and uploaded for better understanding. 

Check **package.json** to check the dependencies needed to run the code.
